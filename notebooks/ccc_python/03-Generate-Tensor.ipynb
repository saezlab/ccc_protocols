    "After inferring communication scores for combinations of ligand-receptor and sender-receiver cell pairs, we can use that information to identify context-dependent CCC patterns across multiple samples simultaneously by generating a 4D-Communication Tensor. LIANA handily outputs these score as a dataframe that is easy to use for building our tensor.\n",

In this case, the `'magnitude_rank'` score generated by LIANA considers low values as the most important ones, ranging from 0 to 1. However, Tensor-cell2cell requires higher values to be the most important scores, so here we pass a function (`lambda x: 1 - x`) to adapt LIANA's magnitude-rank scores (substracts the LIANA's score from 1). If `None` is passed instead, no transformation will be performed on the communication score.\n",
